Connecting with this strange energy, Sylvaglow unlocked a hidden ability—its vines wrapped around the trap, absorbing and diffusing the energy back into the forest, turning it more vibrant and magical than ever before.\\n\\nRealizing these energies were not meant to be controlled, Dr. Blackthorn saw himself swallowed by his own creation’s output, transported into a vision of a world where nature existed harmoniously without human interference. Struck by the depth of nature’s wisdom and beauty, he experienced an epiphany.\\n\\nEmerging from his trance, now overwhelmed with humility, Blackthorn dismantled his devices. Instead, he chose to dedicate his intellect to preserving the natural order. Sylvaglow, recognizing the change in him, let out a melodic hum.

As they touched the stones, the earth trembled, and Sylvaglow appeared, vines shimmering like never before.\\n\\nThe mythical Pokémon revealed that Eldergreen’s network had been lying dormant, awaiting the right time and guardians to awaken it. As Sylvaglow channeled its energy through the children, visions of other mythical Pokémon emerged—each one, an echo of Sylvaglow, charged with the guardianship of their own forests.\\n\\nNews of this revelation spread quickly, and a sense of unity blossomed within the communities worldwide.
