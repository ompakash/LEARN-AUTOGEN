# ü§ñ Autogen Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository where I document everything I learn about [**AutoGen**](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), a powerful multi-agent framework for building LLM (Large Language Model) applications. This repo is a living notebook of my experiments, examples, and notes as I explore how agents can collaborate using AutoGen.

## üöÄ What is AutoGen?

AutoGen is an open-source framework by Microsoft that simplifies the creation of **multi-agent workflows** using LLMs like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc. It enables developers to:

- Build **agent-based systems** where each agent has a role and function
- Set up **collaborative conversations** between humans and LLM agents
- Integrate **tools, APIs, and function-calling** into agent interactions
